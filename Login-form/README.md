# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

Question 1.

Please recreate the following
Sign-In Component, using the
Java unfolding framework (React, Vue etc)

Please recreate the following Sign-In Component, using the Java unfolding
framework (React, Vue, etc.)
Development info:
• You may use a JS framework + UI component library to speed up development
• The Sign-In component should be responsive to any display resolution
• The Sign-In component should be centered, vertically and horizontally, in the
middle of the screen on any display resolution
• Component alignments, such as “Forgot Password?” and “Sign In”, should be
vertically centered in the same row
• Password managers (e.g Chrome autofill) should detect the form fields
• You are required to render all of the above elements, even if they are nonfunctional
• You should be able to explain your solution

Assessment Requirements
The sign-In component should meet the following requirements:
• A simple email or password validation after clicking “Sign In”
• A progress indicator of your choice after clicking “Sign In” (some brief timeout is
sufficient)
• “Forgot Password?” and “Create an Account” with correct tags and labels
• A dropdown for “Select Language” with a few languages in the menu
• Light and dark modes using the “Brightness” icon as a toggle
Optional: Create, with your best judgment and design, components to display
when a user clicks “Forgot Password?” and “Create an Account”
• Your elements may simply include simple text fields or something more extensive
• What would you ask from the user? Who is your audience?
• These components are your playground, feel free to use your imagination


Question 2.

Requirement code test:
There is a robot which can move around on a grid. The robot is placed at point (0,0).
From (x, y) the robot can move to (x+1, y), (x-1, y), (x, y+1), and (x, y-1). Some points
are dangerous and contain EMP Mines. To know which points are safe, we check
whether the sum digits of abs(x) plus the sum of the digits of abs(y) are less than or
equal to 23. For example, the point (59,75) is not safe because 5 + 9 + 7 + 5 = 26,
which is greater than 23. The point (-51, -7) is safe because 5 + 1 + 7 = 13, which is
less than 23
Question:
• How large is the area that the robot can access?
